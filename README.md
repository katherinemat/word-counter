1. Return the word the user types in because this is the simplest task a user would want the program to perform; input: steak; output: steak
2. Check that two words that the user enters are the same. Comparing one word to itself is the easiest instance to check for a match; input: tennis, tennis; output: true
3. Compare two sentences to see if they are equal. This is similar to the previous spec, just making sure that spaces and other special characters are taken into consideration; input: I can't!, I can't!; output: true
4. Return true if a word is contained once in a sentence. This is the next step and most natural transition to begin counting instances of a word; input: That dog is happy, dog; output: true
5. Return true if sentence has a word, regardless of capitalization. This spec is almost the same as the previous spec, except that it also considers capitalization of word; input: My cat loves me, my; output: true
6. Recognize how many instances of a word are in a sentence because this is as complex as this program is going to get and is the final requirement in terms of functionality. Also, this is what the user would expect in a final product; input: Biggy biggy bIgGy can't you see, biggy; output: 3
